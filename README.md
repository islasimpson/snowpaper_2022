# snowpaper_2022
Contains the scripts for data processing and figure generation to reproduce the results in Simpson et al (2022) "Improvements in wintertime surface temperature variability in the Community Earth System Model version 2 (CESM2) related to the representation of snow density, in JAMES/

The processing of raw CESM data is done in the scripts in ./DATA_SORT and this processed data is then used to make the figures using the scripts in ./FIGURES.  If you would like access to the raw CESM data that is used in the DATA_SORT scripts, please contact Isla Simpson.

Note that some of these scripts make use of subroutines that are in https://github.com/islasimpson/CASanalysis
